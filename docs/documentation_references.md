This repository indexes public and verifiable documents on legitimate key fob resynchronization and programming procedures for vehicles listed in this project.

Restricted or subscription-only OEM files (for example, erWin or Subaru STIS) are cited here with their official links but are not redistributed to comply with licensing.

These materials are included for educational, diagnostic, and lawful owner-led repair purposes only.
